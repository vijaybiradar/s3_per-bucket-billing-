Per bucket billing data — Tags

Tags in the Cost Explorer refer to Cost Allocation Tags. The tags need to be assigned to the buckets first so as to enable them, thereafter they are able to be used. It’s a simple process that can be done in the “Properties” tab of each bucket.

In our example, I have decided to use tags Name, Purpose, and Team for each bucket. For “Name”, I simply used bucket name. As a “Purpose”, I chose from metrics, . As for “Team”, I had the option of setting it as DevOps observability
